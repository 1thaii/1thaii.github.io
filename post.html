                    <p>Problems look unpretentious from 150 miles away. Oakland, the third largest city in the Bay Area, eighth- largest city in California, and the 45th largest city in the U.S., is an amazing place that is always thought to be something it is not. Even though there is some urban decay and crime rates aren’t as low as we want them to be a lot of us Oaklanders love our city.   

                    <p>Oakland has historically been a central point of many progressive causes, and its activist roots continue as an important part of the culture today, as groups engage in anti-oppression activism and environmental activism. Despite our separations as a city  we are very engaged, aware, and willing to take a stand. </p>

                    <p>Oakland is the home of the unexpected things. Living in Oakland can prepare you for almost anything, here you can not depend on anything to happen or not to happen. From walking to the corner store and being caught in the crossfire of  a shoot out to being on bart and a group of kids start bone breaking ( dancing ) in front of you.</p>

                    <p>Us as youth in Oakland are super talented and take our talents very seriously. From dancing to playing Rugby our talents give us a way out of all of the chaos and a breath of fresh air. Sometimes our talents are what help turn us into better people for example this year over 77% of the seniors at my high school graduated but most were not on track to graduate until they joined a sport or club. </p>

                    <p>Surviving in Oakland is mostly about connections.  To deal with all of the problems here you need a support system but  to even enjoy your time here with  it  being so much hidden talent it’s all about finding people who you connect with. Here in Oakland fight as a city, love as a city, and cry as a city even when you feel there downfalls. Us Oaklanders are a family, sometimes dysfunctional, sometimes separated but we know how to come together when we are suffering.</p>
